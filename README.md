## Overview

Reproduction of the experimental procedure of the global-local paradigm, original paper (Bekinschtein et al., 2009) available [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809667106).

## Plan - for me

### Create stimuli

1. Sound A: Create sine 3 sine waves, each with a different frequency
2. Concatenate these waves
3. Convolve the resulting wave with a window to flatten the gain and loss
4. Repeat 1, 2 and 3 for sound B
5. Do I create series of sounds here and save as .wav files or do I create these series in the procedure part with simple sounds (A and B) saved as .wav files ?

### Create procedure using ready stimuli
