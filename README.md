Reproduction of the experimental procedure of the global-local paradigm, original paper (Bekinschtein et al., 2009) available [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809667106).

## Quick guidelines

As you can see, there are two .py files. Make sure to run create_stimuli.py first, in order to save the stimuli locally on your PC. They are essential to running the exp_design.py file, that is the actual experiment. Also, make sure to store the stimuli and the exp_design.py code in one folder!
